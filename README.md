# SMS Spam Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple machine learning algorithms for binary classification of SMS messages as spam or ham (legitimate). The system evaluates three different approaches to determine the most effective method for automated spam detection.

## Algorithms Used
- **Random Forest** - Ensemble learning method
- **Naive Bayes** - Probabilistic classifier  
- **Bidirectional LSTM** - Deep learning model for sequence analysis
